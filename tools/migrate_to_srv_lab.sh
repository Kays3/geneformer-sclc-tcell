# Move the lab's Geneformer data out of the retired per-machine home directory
# into /srv/lab, group-owned by labusers.
#
# Why: /home/thinkstation{1,2} is mode 750 owned by an account that is no longer
# used, so no current user can read it. Copying it into a personal home would
# work today and break again the next time accounts change. A group-owned path
# with setgid survives account churn and lets every labusers member read it.
#
# /srv/lab is LOCAL to each node. Run this on each node separately; the two
# machines hold different arms of the perturbation run, so neither copy is
# redundant and there is no merge between them.
#
#   sudo bash tools/migrate_to_srv_lab.sh --inventory   # read-only, shows what would move
#   sudo bash tools/migrate_to_srv_lab.sh --migrate     # copy, then set group + setgid
#   sudo bash tools/migrate_to_srv_lab.sh --verify      # re-check counts and permissions
#
# The source is never deleted. Remove it yourself once you have verified the
# copy and no longer need the old account.
